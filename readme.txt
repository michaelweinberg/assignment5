Covid Adventure Group:  Yan Wang, Michael Weinberg, Shine May Hung

*Work each person did:
	Yan:    UML Diagram draft
		Maze construction (dungeon.py, map.py, map_entry_type.py, room.py)
		Main logic--dungeonadventure.py

	Michael:  UML Diagram draft and Final UML Diagram
		  adventurer.py
		  dungeoncontroller.py
		  MVC (Model View Controller) architecture (model--dungeon class, view--dungeonadventure class, controller--dungeoncontroller class)

	Shine May:  UML Diagram draft
		    Main logic--dungeonadventure.py
                    TKinter tester files--input_name.py, cardinal_direction_buttons.py, take_potion.py
		    GUI interface--hooking up GUI Tkinter code to rest of the program
		    adventurer.py

*Estimate of time spent on project:
	Yan:  30 hours
	Michael:  25 hours.  Git Hub coaching.
	Shine May: 40+ hours over two weeks. I spent an embarrassing amount of time as I was starting from zero in terms of Tkinter and game design.
        
*Shortcomings of project:
 	Since the version I demo'ed to you on our Thursday 10am Zoom call, we have additional features in our current code:
		--Automatic notification of room contents before entering a "red" room
		--Pop-up window for Start Game button automatically clears
		--We have put in a notification that you need more pillars when you try to exit without all four pillars
	We hope to be working on a version of the game where the maze is blacked out and you can utilize "Use Vision Potion."
        There is an "Extras" folder with files pertaining to this and the original version I demo'd during our call.

*Other information for grading:
	Extra credit attempted:
		--GUI interface
		--Model View Controller Architecture/Pattern
		--Covid Adventure Theme:  this game can help teach kids safety behaviors during Coronavirus times
